# Star Wars API App

This is a simple Python program that uses the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/) to display a list of movie titles in a GUI. The program uses the `requests` and `tkinter` modules to make HTTP requests to the API and create the GUI, respectively.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The `requests` module (install with `pip install requests`)
- The `tkinter` module (included with most Python installations)

## Usage

This will launch the GUI and display the first page of movie titles. Click the "Load More Movies" button to load additional pages of movies.
